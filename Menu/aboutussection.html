<button class="accordion"><h3>How Does Tinker Web Work?</h3></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>If you are in need of a website, but you are not sure what you need or want; talk to us today. We have catered for websites to people in all different industries. We can offer two different website services; bespoke and content managed websites. To discuss these options we ask for an initial telephone coversation, to see and decide what is best for you and your company. <br>
  <br>
    Terms and Conditions:<br>
    <br>
1.	Website Upfront Costs & Handover <br>
    <br>
We require the following to be paid upfront before your website edit takes place; theme, domain and hosting charges. These must be paid before any website edits take place; you will then be invoiced for the actual website edit after 7 days which is our standard website turnaround period as mentioned in S1. (See S1 1.1 and 1.2)*<br>
    <br>
1.1	Clients must note that website handovers are always based on a 7 day period. If your website edit runs over the 7 period then you must pay an editing fee for the hours your edit has taken up until that point, any more edits will be chargeable on completion of the website (See S1 1.2). All websites will be handed over to the client after a 7 day duration to ensure the project is on track for a 7 day completion. Invoices will always be sent after the 7 day period is up and payment is therefore required three days after this.
<br>
1.2	If your edits take over our standard 7 day turnaround period, an invoice will be sent for the hours chargeable up until that point. Charges for any more edits will be invoiced after the website completion. Please note if you have had a website handover on day 7 but have no more edits left waiting, you can make any suggestions/ edits which will be done free of charge; only one final edit will be done free of charge so ensure you carefully note every edit you wish to be completed by the sales staff. Your free edit does not include added extras (See S2 2.2)<br>
<br>
    2.	Website Charges <br>
    <br>
2.1	All website charges are based upon two costs (2.1, 2.2). Our website package is a standard set rate which includes logo design, domain purchase, email set up, website design and hosting for one year. Please note hosting and domain renewal will be charged every year on the date of the first bank transfer (see S3 3.2). Your logo design is not charged under our general package, however if you require more than 3 edits this will incur a standard hourly charge. You will also receive one free edit after our handover, any edits requested past your one free edit will be chargeable. Please ensure you take this time to list all edits you require, however any items added which are new and were not discussed during the start of the project are not included within this edit. If you wish for extra work to be carried out, this will incur an hourly charge. 
<br>
2.2	For a general website edit we charge by the hour. Clients with already established sites whom are after a simple edit will be charged an hourly rate based on a standard 3 hour edit charge; this is a calculation based on all simple site edits that have been completed by our company. Please note this is not the case for all websites; some websites may take longer than others. This can be due to a variety of reasons; a switch in hosting packages, lack of communication can result in delays and if a client is not clear on what they need done. We as a company will never attempt to re-write written content on a simple website update, you must provide us with content unless we are advised otherwise. <br>
<br>
3.	Hosting Charges <br>
<br>
3.1	Hosting charges are based upon online prices, they do fluctuate each year so you may find your website hosting charge vary per year. Pricing is therefore subject to change without notice upon your renewal. Hosting prices are separate from the website design pricing. All hosting charges are treated as a non-refundable deposit therefore if you change your mind at a later date, we can remove your website but your money will not be refunded this is the case for a website edit too. If your website edits have not been paid in full within 3 days of your editing invoice, your hosting will be cancelled and your website will be removed from our server or any server we use at the time of your website creation. We always take an upfront payment for hosting, domain and theme charges as mentions in S1.
<br>
3.2	Your domain and hosting package is renewed every year, the day of the money transfer is classed as your first day. Therefore renewal will be from one year of the date of the money transfer. We will prompt you a month before this is due and then again one week before, please note if no renewal is paid for, we will removed and shut down your website from our server or any online server we use. If after this date you still want your website up and running, you will be charged for a rebuild. 
<br>
3.3	After one year you are out of contract of our hosting, therefore if you wish to switch you may do so at an incurred charge which will be at the discretion of one of our sales staff. The charge will include their time to point your hosting or domain to another hosting company. <br>
<br>
    4.	Emails<br>
<br>
4.1	Any emails we set up for you come with a storage limit, please think about the storage space you need before asking us to set your emails up for you, we do not know your storage need and you will need to research this yourself. If you require more email storage this will be at an incurred cost. The emails we set up for clients are done for free, so any more storage you need will be at a cost incurred by yourself. Please also note our sales staff may charge a fee at their discretion for setting this up for you. <br>
